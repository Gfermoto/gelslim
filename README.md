# GelSlim 3.0

## Summary
GelSlim 3.0 is a tactile-sensing finger used for the high-resolution measurement of shape, force and slip. We are open sourcing this project to stimulate future research in tactile-sensing and provide the robotics community access to reliable and easily-reproducible tactile finger with a diversity of sensing modalities. Please direct all questions and inquiries to themcubelab@gmail.com  with the subject “GelSlim 3.0 Inquiry - mm/dd/yy - LAB NAME HERE”. The MCube Manipulations and Mechanisms Lab also distributes pre-made sensors by mail upon request.     

## Demonstration
