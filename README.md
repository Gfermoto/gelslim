# GelSlim 3.0

## Summary
GelSlim 3.0 is a tactile-sensing finger used for the high-resolution measurement of shape, force and slip. We are open sourcing this project to stimulate future research in tactile-sensing and provide the robotics community access to reliable and easily-reproducible tactile finger with a diversity of sensing modalities. 

## Demonstration
A demo of the GelSlim 3.0 finger's integrated algorithms for tactile sensing can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y10XN9byO0g
